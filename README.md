In this project, I dived into the Airbnb Boston and Seattle dataset. Here I listed what we have done:<br />

First, the Boston and Seattle Airbnb data are gathered and compared the two dataset.<br />
Machine learning model is trained to predict the rental price for both cities.<br />
The important features are listed of the trained model and check if they make sense.<br />
All the important amenities which people need the most are listed. The host can make more money by providing better services to customersâ€™ need.<br />
